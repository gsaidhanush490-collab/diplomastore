# 🎓 DiplomaStore Smart Contract

DiplomaStore is a beginner-friendly Solidity project that demonstrates how blockchain can be used to securely store and verify academic certificates. This contract allows an admin (owner) to issue and revoke diplomas that anyone can later verify on-chain.

Perfect for learning smart contract fundamentals and Web3 credential systems!
